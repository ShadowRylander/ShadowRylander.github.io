Herein I try to make my current doctoral research accessible to the average person:
Extending dependently-typed languages to implement module system features in the core
language. It's something I can direct my family to, if they're inclined to know what it is
I've been doing lately.

The technical matter can be seen at the associated website
─[[https://alhassy.github.io/next-700-module-systems-proposal/][The Next 700 Module Systems]]─ which includes a poster, slides, and a demo.

Excluding the abstract, this is my thesis proposal in /three minutes/ (•̀ᴗ•́)و
